\subsection*{Slightly faster algorithm for Hamiltonian path. (see Textbook problem 3.31)}
\begin{quote}
    We now consider the Hamiltonian Path decision problem (where a Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once, but does not start and end at the same vertex).
    The na\"{i}ve brute-force algorithm will try to check all $n!$ length-$n$ sequences of unique nodes to see if they are valid paths in the graph.

    We can do slightly better using dynamic programming.

    Finally, show that $2^n \cdot \poly(n)=o(n!)$, so this is a better exponential-time algorithm than the na\"{i}ve brute-force algorithm. (Hint: Use Stirling's Approximation \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirlings_approximation}).
