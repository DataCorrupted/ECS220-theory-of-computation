    \begin{quote}
    Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V| = n$ vertices and $|E| = m$ edges, how many bits do we need to specify the adjacency matrix, and how many do we need to specify an adjacency list? Keep in mind that it takes $\log n$ bits to specify an integer between $1$ and $n$. When are each of these two formats preferable?

    In particular, compare sparse graphs where $m = O(n)$ with dense graphs where $m = \Theta(n^2)$. How do things change if we consider a multigraph, like the graph of the K\"{o}nigsberg bridges, where there can be more than one edge between a pair of points?
