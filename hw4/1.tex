\section{Countability.}
    Recall a set $A$ is \emph{countable} if $|\N| \geq |A|$ and \emph{uncountable} if $|\N| < |A|$.
    %
    Let $S$ be an uncountable set such that $\N \subset S$.
    Show that $|S \setminus \N| = |S|.$
    {\bf Hint:}
    Use the facts that
    1) the union of two countable sets is countable,
    and
    2) every set $R$ with $|R| \geq |\N|$ has a countable subset.

\section*{Solution}

We are going to proof this by construct two bijection functions to proof that $|S \setminus \N| \le |S|$ and $|S \setminus \N| \ge |S|$, which is the standard way to proof that two infinite sets are equal.

\begin{theorem}
    $|S \setminus \N| \le |S|$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Proof this is easy, we can construct an identical map s.t. $\forall x \in S \setminus \N, f(x) = x \in S$.
    This $f$ is bijection and thus proved $|S \setminus \N| \le |S|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    $|S \setminus \N| \ge |S|$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We can get a new countable infinite subset $M$ from $S \setminus \N$. 
    Then it goes without saying that $M \subset S \setminus \N \subset S$, $M \cap \N = \emptyset$.

    Since both $M$ and $\N$ are countable, we can use indexes to label them. 
    From now on, we would use $m_k$ to refer to the k-th element in $M$ and $n_k$ to the k-th element in $\N$.

    Then we can construct a function, which is identical for all element not in $M$ and $\N$, and we condence two countable sets($M$ and $\N$) to one($\N$) for all other elements in $S$:

    \begin{align*}
        \forall x \in S, f(x) = \begin{cases}
            x          & x \in S \setminus (\N \cup M) \\
            n_{2k}     & \exists k, x = n_k \in \N     \\
            n_{2k+1}   & \exists k, x = m_k \in M       
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}

    This is clearly a bijection as all results cannot be the same the each other. 
    Therefore, with this bijection we have $|S \setminus \N| \ge |S|$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
    $|S \setminus \N| = |S|$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $|S \setminus \N| \le |S|$ and $|S \setminus \N| \ge |S|$, $|S \setminus \N| = |S|$.
\end{proof}
