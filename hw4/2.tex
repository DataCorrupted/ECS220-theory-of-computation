\section{More undecidable problems. }
\begin{quote}
    Show that it is undecidable, given the source code of a program $Q$, to tell whether or not any of the following is true:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item $Q$ halts on input 0.
      \item $Q$ is total -- that is, $Q(y)$ halts for all $y$.
      \item $Q(y)=$ {\tt true} for all $y$.
      \item The set of $y$ on which $Q$ halts is finite.
      \item There is a $y$ such that $Q(y)= y$.
      \item Given a second program $R$, $Q$ is equivalent to $R$.
      That is, even though $Q$ and $R$ have different source codes,
      they compute the same partial function --
      for all $y$, either $Q(y)$ and $R(y)$ both halt and return the same answer, or neither halts.
    \end{enumerate}
    Prove each of these by reducing $\textsc{Halting}$ to them.
    That is, show to how convert an instance $(P, x)$ of $\textsc{Halting}$ to an instance of the problem above.
    For instance, you can modify $P$'s source code,
    or write a new program that calls $P$ as a subroutine.
    Each of these is asking for a Turing reduction;
    your reduction does not necessarily have to map yes-instances to yes-instances and no-instances to no-instances --
    all that matters is that if you could solve the problem,
    then you could solve $\textsc{Halting}$.
