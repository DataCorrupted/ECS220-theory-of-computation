\section{In the stratosphere, nondeterminism doesnâ€™t matter.}
    \begin{quote}
    Define $2\uparrow^k n$ as $2^{2^{...2^n}}$, where the tower has $k$ 2's (see also Note 7.12 in the textbook).
    For example $2 \uparrow^3 n = 2^{2^{2^n}}$.
    Now consider the following rather powerful complexity class:
    \[
        \mathsf{ZOWIE} =
        \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \mathsf{TIME}(2\uparrow^k n).
    \]
    Show that $\mathsf{ZOWIE} = \mathsf{NZOWIE}$.
    So, if our computation time is stratospheric enough--if our class of time complexity functions has strong enough closure properties--then nondeterminism makes no difference.
