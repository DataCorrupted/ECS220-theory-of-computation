\section{Matched parentheses}
Suppose we are given a string of parentheses.
First show that telling whether they are properly matched and nested,
such as $(()())$ or $((()))()$ but not $())$ or $())(()$,
is in $\mathsf{L}$.

Now suppose there are two types of parentheses, round ones and square brackets.
We wish to know if they are properly nested: for instance,
$([])[]$ and $[()[]]$ are allowed,
but $([)]$ is not.
Show that this problem is in $\mathsf{L}$.

    {\bf Hint:} Each opening parentheses ( or [ has a ``closing partner'' ) or ].
Ensure that the type of each opening is the same as the type of its closing partner.
