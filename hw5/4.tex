\section{Good old-fashioned Geography. (Textbook problem 8.21)}
Now consider really traditional Geography, where the alphabet is limited to, say, 26 symbols.
More formally,
for a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and alphabet $\Sigma$,
say that $G$ is \emph{$\Sigma$-alphabetic} if there is are functions $f,\ell:V \to \Sigma$
obeying the conditions in the definition of \textsc{Alphabetic-Geography},
and let $\Sigma$\textsc{-Alphabetic-Geography} be the corresponding decision problem asking,
given a $\Sigma$-alphabetic graph $G$ and starting node $v$,
whether Player 1 has a winning strategy starting at $v$.
Show that for each fixed alphabet $\Sigma$,
$\Sigma$\textsc{-Alphabetic-Geography}$\in\mathsf{P}$.
