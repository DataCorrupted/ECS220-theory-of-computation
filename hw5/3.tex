\section{Alphabetic Geography. (Textbook problem 8.20)}
\begin{quote}
    In traditional Geography, a move from a city $u$ to a city $v$ is allowed if $v$ starts with the same letter that $u$ ends with.
    Letâ€™s say that a directed graph $G$ is \emph{alphabetic} if it of this form:
    in other words, if for some finite alphabet $A$,
    each vertex $u$ can be assigned a pair $f(u)$, $\ell(u) \in A$
    such that there is an edge from $u$ to $v$
    if and only if $\ell(u) = f(v)$.
    Give a small example of a graph that is not alphabetic.
    Then show that \textsc{Alphabetic-Geography} is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete,
    by converting any graph to an alphabetic one
    (albeit with an alphabet that grows with the number of vertices).
\end{quote}
The last sentence is asking for a \emph{reduction} from $\textsc{Geography}$ to $\textsc{Alphabetic-Geography}$:
convert any graph $G$ into an alphabetic graph $G_\alpha$ such that
Player 1 has a winning strategy on $G$
if and only if
Player 1 has a winning strategy on $G_\alpha$.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Non-alphabetic graph}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=3cm,on grid,auto, semithick]
        \node [state] (a)               {a};
        \node [state] (b) [right of=a]  {b};

        \path[->]
        (a) edge [loop above] node {1} ()
        (a) edge [bend left] node {2} (b)
        (b) edge [bend left] node {3} (a);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A graph that is not alphabetic}
\end{figure}

This graph is not alphabetic.
As it clearly shows that $l(a) = f(a)$(edge 1), $l(a) = f(b)$(edge 2), $l(b) = f(a)$(edge 3).
Therefore we have $l(b) = f(b)$, indicating that there should also be a self-loop over $b$, but there isn't.
