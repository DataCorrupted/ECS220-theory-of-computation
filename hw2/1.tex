\section*{CNF vs.\ DNF }
    \begin{quote}
    A Boolean formula is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) if it is an OR of clauses,
    each of which is the AND of a set of literals.
    Show that \dnfsat\ (\sat\ restricted to such formulas) is in $\P$.

    Now show that a CNF formula can be converted into a equivalent DNF formula on the same variables.
    Since instances of 3-$\sat$ consist of CNF formulas, why does this not prove that $\P = \NP$?
    {\bf Hint:} consider the formula $(x_1 \vee  y_1) \wedge (x_2 \vee y_2) \wedge \ldots \wedge (x_n \vee y_n).$
    What happens when we convert it to DNF form?
