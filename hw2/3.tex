    $\sat$-1 is a variant of $\tsat$ \emph{no negations}, and each clause is satisfied if \emph{exactly one} of its 3 variables is true.
    For example $\phi = (x \vee y \vee z) \wedge (x \vee a \vee b) \wedge (z \vee b \vee x)$ is satisfied by $x=0,y=1,z=0,a=0,b=1$.
    Prove that $\sat$-1 is $\NP$-complete.
    %In fact, prove that the special case $\textsc{Positive}$ 1-in-3 $\sat$,
    %where no variables are negated, is $\NP$-complete.
    First, make a judicious choice of which $\NP$-complete problem would be easiest to reduce from.
