\section*{Small witnesses are easy to find}
    \begin{quote}
    The definition of $\NP$ requires that the number of bits of the witness is at most polynomial in the number of bits of the input, i.e., $|w| = \poly(n)$.
    Suppose a decision problem $A \in \NP$ has the property that witnesses,
    when they exist, are at most logarithmic size,
    i.e., $|w| = O(\log n)$.
    Show that this implies $A \in \P$.
